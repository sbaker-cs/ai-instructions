== ADR Template Guidelines

=== When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR for decisions that:

* Have significant structural impact on the system
* Are difficult or expensive to reverse
* Affect multiple teams or components
* Establish important precedents
* Involve significant trade-offs

=== When NOT to Write an ADR

Don't write an ADR for:

* Trivial decisions (e.g., variable naming)
* Decisions that are easily reversible
* Implementation details that don't affect architecture
* Temporary workarounds

=== Best Practices

. *One Decision per ADR*: Keep each ADR focused on a single architectural decision
. *Write When Decision is Made*: Capture the context while it's fresh
. *Be Specific*: Avoid vague language; be concrete about the decision
. *Document Alternatives*: Show what was considered and why it wasn't chosen
. *Update Status*: Keep the status field current as decisions evolve
. *Link Related ADRs*: Create a web of connected decisions
. *Review Regularly*: Revisit ADRs periodically to ensure they're still valid
