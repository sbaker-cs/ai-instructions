== Context

Goal & Context (clear problem statement), Key Decisions (what's been agreed), Technical Architecture (for complex features), and Phases (breaking into manageable chunks). Start simple, layer in complexity.

== Goal

* [ ] Goal 1
* [ ] Goal 2
* [ ] Goal 3

== Success Criteria

*Vague:* "Users should be notified." 

*Clear:* "Users receive notifications within 30 seconds of trigger events, with less than 0.1% failure rate, supporting 10k concurrent users." Specificity prevents scope creep and endless iteration.
