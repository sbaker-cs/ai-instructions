= {artifact} AI Instruction Plan
:artifact: [Template]
:project_name: [Project Name]

== Overview

This plan establishes a reusable, language-agnostic and framework-agnostic instruction set for `{project_name}` so any AI agent understands the project's goals, guardrails, and expected collaboration style.

== Context

Goal & Context:: Describe the core problem the agent solves, who benefits, and why it matters right now. Capture only the essentials required to onboard a new contributor.

Key Decisions:: List commitments already made (tooling restrictions, delivery format, reviewer expectations). Flag open decisions explicitly so the agent knows to confirm them.

Technical Architecture:: Summarize integrations, data flow, and critical constraints without prescribing implementation details. Focus on inputs/outputs an AI agent must respect.

Phases:: Break the work into independent chunks the agent can execute or delegate. Highlight prerequisites and potential blockers per phase.

== Goal

* [ ] Capture the user outcomes the instructions must enable.
* [ ] Define collaboration expectations, including asking clarifying questions when unsure.
* [ ] Document constraints that keep the guidance language and framework agnostic.

== Success Criteria

*Vague:* "Agent follows the plan."

*Clear:* "Instructions outline goals, guardrails, and Q/A expectations; reference only technology-agnostic constraints; and explicitly direct the agent to seek clarification whenever information is missing or ambiguous."

== Implementation Checklist

[%interactive]
. Research Inputs
** [ ] Confirm source materials (requirements, prior docs, constraints).
** [ ] Identify stakeholders to ping when clarification gaps appear.
. Draft Instruction Pillars
** [ ] Write purpose and scope statements the agent can restate.
** [ ] Enumerate must-ask questions for ambiguous requirements.
. Validate Neutrality
** [ ] Strip language-, framework-, or vendor-specific assumptions unless mandated.
** [ ] Add guidance for selecting tools when none are specified.
. Publish Template
** [ ] Review with the team and capture feedback deltas inline.
** [ ] Version the template and note how other projects should customize it.
