= {instruction_title} AI Execution Brief
:instruction_title: [Template]
:project_code: [Repo or Project Code]

== Overview

Use this brief to capture the actionable instructions an AI agent must follow while working on `{project_code}`. Keep the wording concise so it can be pasted directly into agent setups or runbooks.

== Context

Goal & Context:: Summarize the user problem, scope boundaries, and expected outcomes. Link to upstream docs if deeper detail exists.

Key Decisions:: Enumerate non-negotiable choices (style guides, review process, testing philosophy). Mark any tentative decisions that still need confirmation.

Technical Architecture:: Note the key systems, interfaces, or data contracts the agent should respect. Avoid tying instructions to a specific language or framework unless absolutely mandatory.

Phases:: Break execution into numbered phases (e.g., Discovery, Build, Validate, Handoff) and outline the success signal and exit criteria for each.

== Goal

* [ ] Provide the agent with a clear mission statement and done definition.
* [ ] Require the agent to ask clarifying questions whenever information is missing or contradictory.
* [ ] Preserve technology neutrality so the template works across stacks and tooling.

== Success Criteria

*Vague:* "The agent knows what to do."

*Clear:* "The brief spells out objectives, constraints, deliverables, and clarification checkpoints; the agent can execute without guessing domain specifics; and every section can be customized without rewriting the structure."

== Implementation Checklist

[%interactive]
. Prepare Inputs
** [ ] Collect product background, user personas, and acceptance expectations.
** [ ] Gather links to repos, environments, or datasets the agent may access.
. Draft Instructions
** [ ] Write step-by-step guidance for each phase, highlighting decision points.
** [ ] Add prompts that nudge the agent to confirm uncertainties before acting.
. Neutrality Review
** [ ] Replace tech-specific examples with abstract/interface-oriented language.
** [ ] List optional technology choices separately from mandatory constraints.
. Finalize Template
** [ ] Peer review or self-audit for missing context and ambiguity.
** [ ] Publish the brief, including notes on how future projects should adapt fields.
