= Performance Optimization Plan - {component-name}
:component-name: [Component/System Name]

== Overview

This plan outlines a systematic approach to improving the performance of {component-name}. Performance optimization should be data-driven, focusing on measurable improvements while maintaining code quality and correctness.

== Context

Performance optimization follows a structured approach:

* Measure first - establish baselines
* Profile to find bottlenecks
* Optimize the slowest parts first (80/20 rule)
* Measure again to verify improvement
* Balance performance with maintainability
