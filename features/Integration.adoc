=== Authentication Flow

[Describe authentication mechanism]

Example for OAuth 2.0:
. Application redirects user to {service-name} authorization URL
. User authorizes application
. {service-name} redirects back with authorization code
. Application exchanges code for access token
. Application uses access token for API requests
. Refresh token before expiration

=== API Endpoints Used

. **Endpoint: [Name/Purpose]**
** URL: [Method] https://api.service.com/v1/endpoint
** Purpose: [What this endpoint does]
** Request:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "field1": "value",
  "field2": 123
}
----
** Response (200 OK):

=== Error Handling Strategy

. **Network Errors**
   - Connection timeout: Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
   - DNS resolution failure: Log and alert, fail gracefully

. **HTTP Errors**
   - 400 Bad Request: Log details, return error to user
   - 401 Unauthorized: Refresh token and retry once
   - 403 Forbidden: Log and alert, insufficient permissions
   - 404 Not Found: Handle as valid response (resource doesn't exist)
   - 429 Too Many Requests: Implement backoff, respect Retry-After header
   - 500 Server Error: Retry up to 3 times
   - 503 Service Unavailable: Retry with exponential backoff

. **Service-Specific Errors**
   - [Error code 1]: [How to handle]
   - [Error code 2]: [How to handle]

. **Circuit Breaker** (if applicable)
   - Open circuit after [X] consecutive failures
   - Half-open after [Y] seconds to test recovery
   - Close circuit after [Z] successful requests

=== Rate Limiting Strategy

Service limits: [X requests per Y time period]

Our strategy:
- Track request count per time window
- Implement token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm
- Queue requests when approaching limit
- Implement backoff when rate limited
- Distribute load across time (avoid bursts)

=== Webhook Handling (if applicable)

. **Webhook Endpoint**: POST /webhooks/service-name
. **Authentication**: Verify signature using shared secret
. **Processing**:
   - Validate signature immediately
   - Return 200 OK quickly (process asynchronously)
   - Store event for processing
   - Implement idempotency check (event ID)
   - Process event in background job
   - Handle event replay (webhooks may be sent multiple times)
