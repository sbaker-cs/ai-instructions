= Technical Documentation Plan - {system-name}
:system-name: [System/Component Name]

== Overview

This plan outlines creating technical documentation for {system-name}. Technical documentation helps developers understand the system architecture, design decisions, and implementation details.

== Context

Technical documentation should include:

* Architecture overview
* Design decisions and rationale
* Component descriptions
* Data flow diagrams
* Deployment architecture
* Development setup
* Contributing guidelines
* Troubleshooting guides

== Questions to Clarify

. **Audience**: Who will read this?
   - [New team members, Contributors, Operations team]

. **System Complexity**: How complex is the system?
   - [Simple, Moderate, Complex]

. **Current State**: Does documentation exist?
   - [None, Partial, Outdated]

. **Documentation Goals**: What should readers understand?
   - [How to set up dev environment, How system works, How to contribute, How to deploy, How to troubleshoot]

== Goals

* [ ] Document system architecture
* [ ] Document key design decisions
* [ ] Create development setup guide
* [ ] Document deployment process
* [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
* [ ] Keep documentation up to date

== Success Criteria

- New developer can set up environment in < {X} hours
- Architecture is clearly diagrammed
- Key design decisions documented with rationale
- All major components documented
- Deployment process is repeatable
- Common issues have documented solutions
