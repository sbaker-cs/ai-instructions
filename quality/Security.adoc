= Security Hardening Plan - {system-name}
:system-name: [System/Feature Name]

== Overview

This plan outlines security measures to protect {system-name} against common vulnerabilities and threats. Security should be considered throughout development, not as an afterthought.

== Context

Security is about protecting:

* Data (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
* Users (privacy, authentication, authorization)
* Systems (availability, integrity)
* Business (reputation, compliance, operations)

== Questions to Clarify

. **System Type**: What are we securing?
   - [Web application, API, Mobile app, Database, Infrastructure, etc.]

. **Data Sensitivity**: What data is handled?
   - [Public, PII, Financial, Health, Credentials, etc.]

. **Compliance Requirements**: What regulations apply?
   - [GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2, None]

. **Threat Model**: What are the main threats?
   - [Unauthorized access, Data breach, DDoS, Injection attacks, etc.]

. **Current Security**: What exists?
   - [Authentication method, Encryption, Firewalls, etc.]

. **Users**: Who uses the system?
   - [Public, Employees, Partners, etc.]

==Goals

* [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
* [ ] Protect against injection attacks
* [ ] Encrypt sensitive data
* [ ] Secure APIs and endpoints
* [ ] Implement security monitoring
* [ ] Ensure compliance with regulations

== Success Criteria

- All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authentication required for all protected endpoints
- Zero high-severity vulnerabilities in security scan
- All inputs validated and sanitized
- Security headers configured
- Audit logging implemented
- Incident response plan documented

== Implementation Checklist

[%interactive]
. **Authentication**
** [ ] Implement secure authentication mechanism
** [ ] Use strong password requirements
** [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (if needed)
** [ ] Secure session management
** [ ] Implement account lockout after failed attempts

. **Authorization**
** [ ] Implement role-based access control
** [ ] Enforce principle of least privilege
** [ ] Validate authorization on every request
** [ ] Protect against privilege escalation

. **Data Protection**
** [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
** [ ] Use TLS/HTTPS for all communications
** [ ] Sanitize data in logs
** [ ] Implement secure key management
** [ ] Secure database connections

. **Input Validation**
** [ ] Validate all inputs server-side
** [ ] Sanitize inputs to prevent injection
** [ ] Implement parameterized queries
** [ ] Validate file uploads
** [ ] Implement rate limiting

. **Security Headers**
** [ ] Content-Security-Policy
** [ ] X-Frame-Options
** [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
** [ ] Strict-Transport-Security

. **Monitoring and Logging**
** [ ] Log security events
** [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
** [ ] Set up alerts for security incidents
** [ ] Implement audit trails

== Common Vulnerabilities

* SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Authentication bypass
* Authorization bypass
* Sensitive data exposure
* XML External Entities (XXE)
* Insecure Deserialization
* Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
* Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
