== Overview

This repository provides a comprehensive collection of language-agnostic and framework-agnostic templates and instructions for working with AI coding assistants. Use these templates to structure your requests, plan implementations, and maintain consistency across your development projects.

== Purpose

When working with AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude, having well-structured prompts and documentation templates leads to:

* *Better AI Understanding*: Clear, structured input helps AI agents comprehend your requirements
* *Consistent Outputs*: Templates ensure AI-generated code and documentation follow your standards
* *Reduced Iteration*: Well-defined requirements minimize back-and-forth clarifications
* *Knowledge Capture*: Document decisions and implementations for future reference

=== Templates Folder

Contains blank, reusable templates for common development scenarios:

* *PlanningDoc.adoc*: Plan new feature implementations with clear goals, context, and checklists
* *BugFixDoc.adoc*: Document bug reports, root cause analysis, and fixes
* *RefactoringDoc.adoc*: Plan code refactoring with rationale and migration strategy
* *ArchitectureDecisionDoc.adoc*: Record architectural decisions (ADR format)
* *CodeReviewDoc.adoc*: Structured code review checklist

=== Instructions Folder

Guides for writing effective AI prompts:

* *PromptingBestPractices.adoc*: Core principles for effective AI prompts
* *FeatureDevelopment.adoc*: Specific prompts for building new features
* *Debugging.adoc*: Prompts to help AI agents debug issues
* *Testing.adoc*: Generate comprehensive test suites

=== Examples Folder

Real-world examples showing templates in action across different scenarios.

== How to Use

=== Quick Start

1. *Choose a Template*: Browse `templates/` folder for your use case
2. *Copy the Template*: Copy template to your project documentation folder
3. *Fill in Details*: Replace placeholders with your specific requirements
4. *Share with AI*: Use filled template as context when prompting AI assistants

=== Best Practices

. *Be Specific*: Replace all `[placeholder]` text with concrete details
. *Include Context*: Add relevant background information in the Context section
. *Define Success*: Write measurable success criteria to prevent scope creep
. *Use Checklists*: Break work into small, verifiable steps
. *Ask Questions*: If unsure about requirements, ask clarifying questions first

=== Example Workflow

[source,adoc]
----
# 1. Copy template
cp templates/PlanningDoc.adoc my-project/docs/PaymentIntegration.adoc

# 2. Fill in details
# Edit PaymentIntegration.adoc with your specific requirements

# 3. Use with AI
# Reference the file: "@/docs/PaymentIntegration.adoc implement the payment gateway"

== Language & Framework Agnostic

All templates are designed to work with any:

* Programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Go, Rust, etc.)
* Frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Django, Spring, .NET, etc.)
* Platforms (Web, Mobile, Desktop, Cloud, Embedded, etc.)
* Tools (IDEs, version control, CI/CD, etc.)

Simply fill in the template with your technology stack specifics.

== Contributing

To add new templates or improve existing ones:

1. Follow the structure established in existing templates
2. Keep content language/framework agnostic
3. Use AsciiDoc format
4. Include clear examples and placeholders
5. Test with multiple AI assistants

== Questions & Feedback

When using these templates, if you're unsure about:

* What technology to use → Ask the AI for recommendations
* How to structure something → Ask for architectural guidance
* What the best approach is → Ask for trade-offs and alternatives

The templates are designed to prompt you and the AI to have these conversations.

Feel free to use and adapt these templates for your projects.
