`template/PlanningDoc.adoc`:: Base reference for the structure every instruction artifact should follow.

`template/instructions/AIInstructionPlan.adoc`:: Planning template that helps teams gather the context and constraints an AI agent needs before writing the final brief.

`template/instructions/AIExecutionBrief.adoc`:: Drop-in execution brief for configuring or onboarding AI agents; keeps requirements explicit, asks for clarification when unsure, and avoids locking to a particular stack.
