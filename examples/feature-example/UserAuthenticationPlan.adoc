= User Authentication Implementation Plan
:feature: User Authentication
:toc: left
:icons: font

== Overview

This plan outlines the steps to implement User Authentication within the application. This feature will enable users to securely create accounts, log in, and access protected resources with session management and role-based access control.

== Context

=== Problem Statement
Currently, the application has no authentication system. All resources are publicly accessible, and there's no way to identify users or protect sensitive data. We need a secure authentication system to support personalized user experiences and protect user data.

=== Current State
- Application is publicly accessible without any authentication
- No user management system
- No session management
- No authorization or role-based access control
- Static content is served to all visitors

=== Proposed Solution
Implement a JWT-based authentication system with:
- Email and password registration/login
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- Access tokens (short-lived, 15 minutes) and refresh tokens (long-lived, 7 days)
- Role-based authorization (User, Admin roles)
- Password reset flow via email

=== Key Decisions

* *Decision 1*: Use JWT tokens instead of session-based auth for better scalability with microservices architecture
* *Decision 2*: Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security
* *Decision 3*: Use bcrypt with 12 rounds for password hashing (balance of security and performance)
* *Decision 4*: Store refresh tokens in httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks

=== Technical Architecture

* *Components*:
  - Auth Service (handles registration, login, token refresh)
  - User Service (manages user profiles)
  - Auth Middleware (validates JWT tokens)
  - Password Reset Service (handles forgot password flow)

* *Data Model*:
  - Users table: id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at
  - Refresh Tokens table: id, user_id, token_hash, expires_at, revoked_at

* *External Dependencies*:
  - jsonwebtoken (JWT token generation/validation)
  - bcryptjs (password hashing)
  - nodemailer (email sending for password reset)

* *Integration Points*:
  - All protected API routes will use auth middleware
  - Frontend will store access token in memory
  - Refresh token stored in httpOnly cookie

=== Open Questions

. Should we implement OAuth (Google, GitHub) in phase 1 or phase 2?
. Do we need email verification before allowing login?
. Should we implement rate limiting on auth endpoints?
. What's our password complexity requirements policy?

== Goals

Clear, measurable objectives for this implementation:

* [x] *Goal 1*: Users can register with email and password
* [x] *Goal 2*: Users can log in and receive JWT tokens
* [x] *Goal 3*: Protected routes verify JWT tokens and reject unauthorized access
* [x] *Goal 4*: Users can refresh tokens without re-logging in
* [x] *Goal 5*: Admin users have access to admin-only routes

== Success Criteria

=== Functional Requirements

* *Requirement 1*: Users can register with valid email and password, receiving confirmation
* *Requirement 2*: Users can log in with correct credentials and receive access/refresh tokens
* *Requirement 3*: Protected API endpoints return 401 for missing/invalid tokens
* *Requirement 4*: Access tokens expire after 15 minutes, refresh tokens after 7 days
* *Requirement 5*: Users can use refresh token to get new access token
* *Requirement 6*: Admin users can access admin routes, regular users cannot
* *Requirement 7*: Password reset flow works via email link

=== Non-Functional Requirements

* *Performance*: Login/registration responds within 500ms under normal load
* *Security*: 
  - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
  - JWT tokens signed with RS256
  - Refresh tokens stored as hashed values
  - Rate limiting: 5 failed login attempts per 15 minutes
* *Reliability*: Auth system available 99.9% uptime
* *Usability*: Clear error messages for authentication failures

=== Out of Scope

* OAuth/Social login (deferred to phase 2)
* Two-factor authentication (deferred to phase 2)
* Email verification requirement (will add in phase 2)
* Account lockout after repeated failures (phase 2)
* Password history to prevent reuse (phase 2)

== Testing Strategy

=== Unit Tests
- Test password hashing and verification
- Test JWT token generation and validation
- Test each auth function in isolation
- Target: >90% code coverage

=== Integration Tests
- Test complete registration flow
- Test login flow
- Test token refresh flow
- Test protected route access
- Test password reset flow

=== End-to-End Tests
- User registers → logs in → accesses protected page → logs out
- User forgets password → resets → logs in with new password
- Invalid login attempts → appropriate errors

=== Manual Testing
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile responsiveness
- Error message clarity
- User experience flow

== Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise in production:

. Enable feature flag to disable new auth system
. Redirect users to maintenance page
. Rollback database migrations if schema issues
. Revert to previous deployment
. Investigate issues in staging environment
. Apply fix and re-deploy

== Monitoring & Metrics

* *Successful Logins*: Track daily successful login count
* *Failed Login Attempts*: Alert if >100 failures in 5 minutes (possible attack)
* *Registration Rate*: Track new user registrations per day
* *Token Refresh Rate*: Monitor refresh token usage
* *Auth Endpoint Response Time*: Alert if p95 > 1 second
* *Auth Error Rate*: Alert if error rate > 5%

== Timeline

* *Phase 1*: 1 day
* *Phase 2*: 2 days
* *Phase 3*: 5 days
* *Phase 4*: 4 days
* *Phase 5*: 3 days
* *Phase 6*: 2 days
* *Total Estimated Time*: 17 days (3.5 weeks)
