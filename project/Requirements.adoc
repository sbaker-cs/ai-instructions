= {project-name} - Requirements Gathering and Analysis Plan
:project-name: [Your Project Name]

== Overview

This plan outlines a structured approach to gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements for {project-name}. Clear requirements are essential for successful software development, ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what needs to be built and why.

== Context

Requirements gathering should uncover:

* What problems the software will solve
* Who will use the software and how
* What constraints and limitations exist
* What success looks like

This template helps AI agents systematically gather requirements by asking the right questions and organizing information effectively.

* [ ] Get stakeholder sign-off on requirements

== Success Criteria

*Vague:* "Requirements should be complete and everyone should agree."

*Clear:*
- All functional requirements have acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements include measurable targets
- Each requirement is assigned a priority (Must-have, Should-have, Nice-to-have)
- Zero conflicting requirements remain unresolved
- At least {N} stakeholders have reviewed and approved
- Requirements traceability matrix links requirements to business goals
