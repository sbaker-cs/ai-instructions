= {project-name} - Initial Project Setup Plan
:project-name: [Your Project Name]

== Overview

This plan outlines the steps to set up a new software project from scratch with AI assistance. This includes selecting the technology stack, initializing the project structure, configuring development tools, and establishing best practices for the development lifecycle.

== Context

Before proceeding with project setup, the AI agent needs to understand:

* The project's purpose and target users
* Technical constraints (hosting environment, performance requirements, compliance needs)
* Team size and experience level
* Timeline and budget considerations
* Integration requirements with existing systems

== Questions to Clarify

Before creating the setup plan, please provide answers to these questions:

. **Project Purpose**: What problem does this project solve? Who are the end users?

. **Programming Language**: Do you have a preferred language, or should the AI suggest options based on requirements?
   - Examples: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, C#, PHP

. **Project Type**: What type of application are you building?
   - Web application (frontend, backend, full-stack)
   - Mobile application (native, cross-platform)
   - Desktop application
   - CLI tool
   - Library/SDK
   - Microservice
   - Data pipeline
   - Other: [specify]

. **Framework Preferences**: Are there any framework requirements or preferences?
   - If web: [React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, etc.]
   - If backend: [Express, Django, Spring, FastAPI, etc.]
   - If mobile: [React Native, Flutter, Swift, Kotlin, etc.]
   - Or: "Let AI suggest"

. **Database Requirements**: Will this project need a database?
   - Type: [Relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis), Document (DynamoDB), Graph, Time-series]
   - Or: "Not needed"
   - Or: "Let AI suggest"

. **Development Environment**: What operating systems will the team use?
   - [Windows, macOS, Linux, Mixed]

. **Version Control**: Is there an existing repository, or should we initialize a new one?
   - [New repository, Existing repository URL, Monorepo]

. **CI/CD Requirements**: Do you need continuous integration/deployment setup?
   - Platform: [GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI, None yet]

. **Testing Requirements**: What level of testing is expected?
   - Unit tests required
   - Integration tests required
   - E2E tests required
   - Let AI suggest based on best practices

. **Package Management**: Are there preferences for dependency management?
   - Or: "Use language defaults"

== Goals

Based on your answers above, the goals are:

* [ ] Initialize project repository with proper structure
* [ ] Configure development environment and tooling
* [ ] Set up dependency management
* [ ] Establish coding standards and linting
* [ ] Configure testing framework
* [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (if needed)
* [ ] Create initial documentation

== Success Criteria

*Vague:* "Project should be set up properly."

*Clear:*
- Developer can clone repository and run the project within 5 minutes using documented setup steps
- All team members have consistent development environments
- Linting and formatting rules are enforced automatically
- CI pipeline runs tests on every commit
- Project includes README with setup instructions, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines

== Implementation Checklist

[%interactive]
. **Repository Setup**
** [ ] Initialize version control repository
** [ ] Create .gitignore file appropriate for {language/framework}
** [ ] Set up branch protection rules (if applicable)
** [ ] Configure repository settings (access, collaborators)

. **Project Structure**
** [ ] Create directory structure following {language/framework} conventions
** [ ] Initialize project manifest (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.)
** [ ] Set up source and test directories
** [ ] Create configuration directories (config/, .github/, etc.)

. **Development Environment**
** [ ] Document required software versions ({language}, {framework}, etc.)
** [ ] Create environment setup script or document setup steps
** [ ] Configure environment variables template (.env.example)
** [ ] Set up containerization (Docker) if needed

. **Code Quality Tools**
** [ ] Configure linter ({ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop, etc.})
** [ ] Configure code formatter ({Prettier, Black, rustfmt, etc.})
** [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
** [ ] Configure static analysis tools (if applicable)

. **Testing Framework**
** [ ] Install and configure test framework ({Jest, pytest, JUnit, etc.})
** [ ] Create test directory structure
** [ ] Write example test to verify setup
** [ ] Configure code coverage reporting

. **Build and Run**
** [ ] Configure build tools ({Webpack, Vite, Maven, Gradle, etc.})
** [ ] Create development run scripts
** [ ] Create production build scripts
** [ ] Document build and run commands

. **Dependency Management**
** [ ] Initialize dependency management
** [ ] Install core dependencies
** [ ] Install development dependencies
** [ ] Document dependency update policy

. **CI/CD Pipeline**
** [ ] Create CI configuration file (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, etc.)
** [ ] Set up automated testing on pull requests
** [ ] Configure build verification
** [ ] Set up deployment pipeline (if applicable)

. **Documentation**
** [ ] Create README.md with project overview
** [ ] Document setup instructions
** [ ] Document common development tasks
** [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines
** [ ] Set up architecture documentation (if complex)
** [ ] Create API documentation (if applicable)

. **Initial Code**
** [ ] Create main entry point
** [ ] Implement "Hello World" or basic functionality to verify setup
** [ ] Create example test that passes
** [ ] Verify all tools work together correctly

== Post-Setup Verification

After completing the checklist, verify:

. Clone repository to fresh directory
. Follow setup instructions exactly as documented
. Run linter: [command] - should pass
. Run tests: [command] - should pass
. Run application: [command] - should start successfully
. Make a trivial change and verify pre-commit hooks work
. Create a test pull request and verify CI runs

== Next Steps

After initial setup is complete:

. [ ] Define first feature or milestone
. [ ] Set up project management (issues, boards)
. [ ] Schedule team walkthrough of setup
. [ ] Begin development on core functionality
